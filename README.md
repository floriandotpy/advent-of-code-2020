Advent of Code 2020

My personal solutions to https://adventofcode.com/2020

I am using Python 3, so far without any external libraries. Python 3.6 or newer is needed, as I use features such as f-strings. Most likely, your OS comes with a recent enough version preinstalled (macOS and most Linux distributions will).

```sh
$ python3 -V
Python 3.7.0
```

To run the scripts, just pass them to your Python interpreter on the command line.

```sh
cd day-3
python3 day-3.py
```
